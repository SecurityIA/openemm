	<title>Target group search</title>
	<content><![CDATA[The target groups search allows you to search using both the name and description fields. If you would like to enter multiple terms at the same time then you can use the following options:<br><br>
<b>Specific search using quotation marks</b><br><br>
For example: “daily recipients”<br><br>
If two or more terms are enclosed in quotation marks, the EMM will search fields using this specific sequence of words. No results containing only one of the words will be displayed.<br><br>
<b>Combination using the plus sign</b><br><br>
For example: “daily recipients” + women<br><br>
If two or more terms are linked by a plus sign, only results containing all terms will be displayed.<br><br>
<b>Combination using the space bar</b><br><br>
For example: women men<br><br>
Where two or more terms are separated by a space, this is referred to as an OR search. All hits will be shown that contain at least one of the search terms entered.<br><br>
<b>Terms in brackets</b><br><br>
For example: “daily recipients” + (women men)<br><br>
The example displayed would show all hits that both contain the phrase “daily recipients” and also contain either woman or men. However, the result must contain at least one of the terms in brackets since these are connected by a plus sign.<br><br>
It is possible to use the various combination options in any order you wish.<br><br>
For example: "daily recipients" + (women men) + (“older than 30” "younger 30")]]></content>
