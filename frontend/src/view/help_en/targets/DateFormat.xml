	<title>Date format for date comparisons</title>
	<content><![CDATA[For date comparisons, please specify the format to be used for the comparison on both date values to be compared.
As a rule, you should use the date format "YYYYMMDD", which compares to the full date.
For comparisons on birthdays please use the format "MMDD", so in this case only months and days will be compared.
